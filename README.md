# Youtube mute-skip Reiwa-latest version

Firefox Addon mutes ads and gives you meditation time and clicks "Skip" button automatically.
This is not an Ad blocker.

**Verified the Addon worked on Firefox146.0** (as of 2026/Jan/1st).

This Addon is based on the following Addons:
- https://github.com/eperezcosano/yt-ad-autoskipper
- https://github.com/squgeim/yt-ad-autoskipper

Those Addons havenot been maintained for years; I just merged them and cleaned some files. I didnot really do anything. Thank you to everyone who was involved in the development.
